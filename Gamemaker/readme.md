# Gamemaker Games

The following games were made by a group of four students. 
Three of use were in an Intro to Game Design and Development class.
The fourth member was in a Game Design and Graphics class. 
I was the programmer for both games, so It was my job to do the majority of the programming for both games.
  
## Superstore Showdown
For this game, we had to make a game that related in some way to the pandemic.
We decided to make a game related to the early fears of grocery shopping during the Covid pandemic.  
The game can be found at this repo: [Superstore Showdown](https://github.com/hcoconnor/SuperstoreShowdown)

## Arcane Assault
For this game, we could make what ever game we wanted. 
After some brainstorming, we decided to make a beat 'em up type game starring a wizard who could shoot fireball and summon companions.
For this game, while I did do the vast majority of the coding, I did get a bit of help from one of my groupmate with implementing some of the final sprites 
so that I had time to focus of other things that needed to get coded.  
This game can be found at this repo (version 3 is the final version): [Arcane Assault](https://github.com/hcoconnor/ArcaneAssault)
